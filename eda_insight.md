## Attributes that are correlation with the Target
# attributes with high correlation to 'Calories'
attribute_list = ['Calories', 'Weight (kg)', 'lean_mass_kg', 'BMI', 'BMI_calc', 'Fat_Percentage', 'cal_balance', 'protein_per_kg']
Thought presence of BMI_calc, cal_balance shows multicolinearity and should be droped


## Relationship between Target and Categorical values
Body_Part`, `Benefit`, and `Equipment_Needed`- these 3 features shows some predictive power from running the MI Scores
# ANOVA Results Interpretation

- **p-value:**  
  The p-value tells you if the differences you see in the data are statistically significant.  
  - A common threshold is **p < 0.05**.  
  - If the p-value is less than 0.05, it means there is a statistically significant difference in the average *Calories* across the groups of that feature.  

- **Eta-squared:**  
  This value (ranging from **0 to 1**) measures the proportion of variance in *Calories* that is explained by the feature. It represents the **effect size**.  
  - **Small effect:** 0.01  
  - **Medium effect:** 0.06  
  - **Large effect:** 0.14  

- **Combined Interpretation:**  
  You should consider both the **statistical significance (p-value)** and the **magnitude of the effect (Eta-squared)** to get a full picture.

## Interpreting the Results for Each Feature

### Features with the Highest Effect Size (Eta-squared)

#### 1. `meal_name`
- **Eta-squared:** 0.041014  
- **p-value:** 0.983708  
- **Interpretation:**  
  `meal_name` explains the largest proportion of variance in *Calories* among all the features.  
  However, its p-value is very high, meaning the effect is **not statistically significant** and could be due to random chance.  
  You **cannot confidently conclude** that specific meal names lead to different calorie counts based on this test.

---

#### 2. `Benefit`
- **Eta-squared:** 0.002387  
- **p-value:** 0.483456  
- **Interpretation:**  
  This feature has a **very small effect** on *Calories* and the relationship is **not statistically significant**.

---

#### 3. `Name_of_Exercise`
- **Eta-squared:** 0.002349  
- **p-value:** 0.740394  
- **Interpretation:**  
  The effect of `Name_of_Exercise` on *Calories* is **very small** and **not statistically significant**.

---

### Features with a Statistically Significant Relationship (p < 0.05)

#### 1. `diet_type`
- **Eta-squared:** 0.000664  
- **p-value:** 0.020922  
- **Interpretation:**  
  The difference in average *Calories* across different `diet_type` categories is **statistically significant**.  
  However, the Eta-squared value is **extremely small**, meaning that while the difference is real, `diet_type` explains only a **tiny fraction** of the variation in *Calories*.  
   **Statistically significant but weak predictor.**

---

#### 2. `Workout_Type`
- **Eta-squared:** 0.000398  
- **p-value:** 0.046888  
- **Interpretation:**  
  Similar to `diet_type`, the relationship is **statistically significant**, but the **effect size is very small**.  
  Different workout types do lead to different average calorie counts, but `Workout_Type` is **not a strong predictor** on its own.

---

###  Features with No Significant Relationship

All other features —  
`Workout`, `Equipment_Needed`, `cooking_method`, `Body_Part`, `Type_of_Muscle`, `meal_type`, `Difficulty_Level`, and `Gender` —  
have **high p-values (all > 0.05)** and **low Eta-squared values**.

There is **no statistically significant evidence** to suggest that these features have a relationship with *Calories*.

| Workout_Type        | 0.000398    | 0.046888  |  Yes        | Statistically significant but weak effect |
| Others              | —           | > 0.05    |  No         | No significant relationship |

---

 **Conclusion:**  
Only `diet_type` and `Workout_Type` show statistically significant relationships with *Calories*, but both have **very weak effects**.  
All other categorical features show **no significant relationship**.

# Interpreting Mutual Information (MI) Scores for Calories

## Understanding Mutual Information

**Mutual Information (MI)** is a non-negative value that measures the dependency between two variables.  
- A score of **0** means the variables are *independent*.  
- A higher value indicates a *stronger dependency*.  
- Unlike correlation, MI can capture **non-linear** relationships.  

---

## Interpretation of Each Feature’s Relationship with Calories

### Features with Some Dependency on Calories

#### 1. `Body_Part` (MI: **0.009457**)
- This feature has the **strongest relationship** with *Calories* among the categorical variables.  
- This suggests that the body part being worked out (e.g., legs, arms, core) provides **some information** about calorie count.  
- However, the score is still quite low, indicating a **weak-to-moderate dependency**.

---

#### 2. `Benefit` (MI: **0.006863**)
- The type of benefit (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain) has a **weak relationship** with *Calories*.  
- Provides *some information*, but not a strong predictor.

---

#### 3. `Equipment_Needed` (MI: **0.006244**)
- Equipment required for an exercise shows a **weak dependency** on *Calories*.  
- This is logical, as certain equipment might be associated with exercises that burn more or fewer calories.

---

#### 4. `Workout` (MI: **0.003618**)
- Shows a **very weak relationship** with *Calories*.  
- Adds minimal predictive value.

---

#### 5. `Target_Muscle_Group` (MI: **0.000183**)
- Has a **negligible (almost zero)** relationship with *Calories*.  
- Practically independent.

---

### Features Independent of Calories

The following features have **MI = 0.000000**, meaning they are **completely independent** of *Calories*:  
Knowing their values gives **no information** about the calorie count.

- `Gender`  
- `cooking_method`  
- `diet_type`  
- `meal_type`  
- `meal_name`  
- `Workout_Type`  
- `Name_of_Exercise`  
- `Difficulty_Level`  
- `Type_of_Muscle`  

---

## Comparison: ANOVA vs. Mutual Information

It is insightful to compare the MI results with the earlier **ANOVA** output.

### 1. `meal_name`
- **ANOVA:** Largest Eta-squared (**0.041014**) but a very high p-value (**0.983708**).  
- **MI:** Score = 0.  
- **Interpretation:**  
  The ANOVA found large variance but it wasn’t statistically meaningful — likely due to random chance.  
  The MI score confirms this by showing **no dependency**.

---

### 2. `diet_type` and `Workout_Type`
- **ANOVA:** Statistically significant (p < 0.05) but with *very small* effect sizes.  
- **MI:** Score = 0.  
- **Interpretation:**  
  These results appear contradictory at first, but they actually complement each other.  
  - The ANOVA test is sensitive to even **tiny differences in means** (especially with large datasets).  
  - MI measures **how much information** a feature provides for prediction.  
  The zero MI scores indicate that, although differences in means exist, **they are too small to matter for prediction**.

---

## Why ANOVA and MI Results Differ

### ANOVA Tests for Differences in Means
- ANOVA checks if the **mean of Calories** differs across categories (e.g., diet types).  
- With a **large sample (20,000 rows)**, ANOVA can detect *very small differences* and mark them as statistically significant (low p-value).  
- However, this does **not** mean the difference is practically important.

### Mutual Information Measures Predictive Dependency
- MI quantifies how much **knowing a feature reduces uncertainty** about the target.  
- MI = 0 means the feature provides **no predictive information**.  
- MI doesn’t care about mean differences — it focuses on **predictive usefulness**.

---

## Interpreting the Discrepancy

The key insight is:

> ANOVA found a **tiny, statistically significant** difference (due to sample size), while MI found **no practical predictive relationship**.

Think of it like this:  
> A precise scale detects a difference of 0.001 grams between two sand piles.  
> This is statistically significant, but practically meaningless — it doesn’t change your construction outcome.  
> MI tells you this difference doesn’t help predict anything useful.

---

## Should You Drop `diet_type` and `Workout_Type`?

For **predictive modeling**, the answer is generally **yes**.

- **Predictive power:** MI = 0 means no useful information for prediction.  
- **Statistical significance:** ANOVA’s significance here is **not practically important**.  
- **Model simplicity:** Keeping features that don’t add value increases noise and computational cost.

**Drop these features** unless:
- **Domain knowledge** suggests they are essential (e.g., strong theoretical reason).  
- You suspect a **non-linear relationship** MI didn’t capture — then try feature engineering or transformations.

## 🧠 Conclusion for Predictive Modeling

- **Keep and Investigate:**  
  `Body_Part`, `Benefit`, and `Equipment_Needed` — these show some weak dependencies and might add small predictive value.

- **Consider Dropping:**  
  All features with **MI = 0**, especially `diet_type` and `Workout_Type`, as they add **no information** for prediction.

- **Key Takeaway:**  
  The MI results provide a **clearer measure of predictive usefulness** than ANOVA p-values.  
  Use **Mutual Information** to guide feature selection for modeling and trust it over mere statistical significance when your goal is prediction.
