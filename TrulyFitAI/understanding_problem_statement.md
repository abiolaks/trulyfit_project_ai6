# Reframing the Calorie Prediction Problem

## The Core Problem

The challenge is that we want to **predict a target variable (daily calorie target)** that **does not exist** in our dataset.  
The dataset instead contains a related variable â€” **calorie intake from food**.

Since we cannot build a supervised machine learning model to predict a variable that isn't in the data,  
we **reframe your goal** to model what *is* available.

## Approach and Assumption for building the Predictive Model

## The Best Approach: A Two-Part Workflow

You can address this issue by following a **two-part workflow**:

1. **Part 1:** Model the relationship between your features and *calorie intake from food*.  
2. **Part 2:** Connect the model's output to a *daily calorie target* using metabolic formulas and goals.

##  Part 1: Model the Relationship Between Features and Calorie Intake from Food

Your dataset already includes features like `bmi`, `height`, `weight`, `age`, and others â€” all of which influence calorie consumption.

You can build a **regression model** to predict *calorie intake from food* using these inputs.

###  Steps for Building This Model

#### 1. **Feature Selection**
- Using analysis (**ANOVA**, **Mutual Information**) to choose informative categorical features.  
- Based on our results:  
  - **we Keep:** `Body_Part`, `Benefit`, `Equipment_Needed`  
  - **we Drop:** Features with zero mutual information (no predictive value).

---

#### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Encode Categorical Features:**  
  - Use `BinaryEncoder` for features with **high cardinality**.  
  - Use `OneHotEncoder` for features with **low cardinality**.  

- **Scale Numerical Features:**  
  - Apply `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` on numerical features like:
    - `bmi`
    - `height`
    - `weight`
    - `age`
  - Scaling ensures stable model performance and better convergence for most regression algorithms.

#### 3. **Model Selection**
Choose a regression model suited to your data:

| Model | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Simple, interpretable baseline; captures linear trends only. |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | Ensemble-based, captures non-linear relationships and interactions. |
| **Gradient Boosting Regressor** | Boosted trees, often achieves high accuracy on structured data. |
| **XGBoost Regressor** | Highly efficient gradient boosting model; strong performance in real-world use. |

---

#### 4. **Training and Evaluation**

Steps:
1. Split your dataset into **training** and **test** sets.
2. Train the chosen regression model on the **training** data.
3. Evaluate on the **test** data using metrics such as:
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
   - **R-squared (RÂ²)**

This model will allow you to **predict a personâ€™s typical calorie intake from food** based on their characteristics and activity details.

## ðŸ”— Part 2: Connect the Modelâ€™s Output to the Daily Calorie Target

A **daily calorie target** is not a value to predict directly from data.  
Instead, itâ€™s a **calculated value** â€” based on a personâ€™s **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** and their **goal** (maintenance, loss, or gain).

What we did was to  use the **output of your model (Part 1)** as an **approximation of TDEE**, assuming that for most individuals,  
> Calorie intake â‰ˆ TDEE (when maintaining weight).

---

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Predict TDEE
Use your trained regression model to predict **calorie intake from food** for a new user.  
Example:  
> Predicted intake = **2,500 calories**

#### Step 2: Interpret as TDEE
Interpret this prediction as their **approximate TDEE**, assuming they are maintaining weight.

#### Step 3: Adjust for Goal
Adjust the calorie target based on the userâ€™s goal:

| Goal | Formula | Example Target |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Maintenance** | `TDEE` | **2,500 calories** |
| **Weight Loss** | `TDEE - 500` | **2,000 calories** |
| **Weight Gain** | `TDEE + 500` | **3,000 calories** |

## ðŸ§­ Final Summary

we followed this **two-part approach**:- and below is the workflow:

- We use the **existing data** from Kaggle - lifestyle to train a meaningful model.  
- Predict **calorie intake from food** as a proxy for **TDEE**.  
- Translate model outputs into **personalized daily calorie targets** based on user goals.

Even though the original dataset lacks a direct *daily calorie target* variable,  
this workflow creates a **practical, data-driven, and goal-oriented calorie recommendation system**.
