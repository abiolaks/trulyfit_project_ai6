#  Fitness Recommendation AI — End-to-End Project Documentation

##  1. Problem Statement

Modern fitness journeys often fail due to one-size-fits-all meal and workout plans that ignore individual differences in body type, metabolism, goals, and adherence levels.  
People struggle to:
- Know *how many calories they need per day* to reach their goals.  
- Get *personalized meal and exercise plans* that fit their lifestyle.  
- Receive *adaptive recommendations* based on their real progress over time.  

This project aims to solve these problems using *Machine Learning (ML)* and *data-driven personalization*.

---

## 2. Project Objective

To build an *AI-powered fitness recommendation system* that:
1. Predicts a user’s *daily calorie requirement* based on personal attributes and goals.  
2. Generates a *personalized meal plan* and *workout routine* that align with the calorie target and goal.  
3. Tracks user progress over time (weight, adherence, energy level) to *adapt recommendations* dynamically.  

The end goal is to provide an intelligent, continuously learning fitness assistant.

## 3. Methodology Overview

The system will be developed in *phases*, evolving from a rule-based MVP to an adaptive ML system.

| Phase | Focus | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| *Phase 1* | Data Setup | Gather and structure user profile, meal, and workout datasets. |
| *Phase 2* | Calorie Prediction | Build a regression model to predict daily calorie needs based on user profile. |
| *Phase 3* | Personalized Recommendation | Generate meals and workouts matching calorie goals and user preferences. |
| *Phase 4* | Progress Tracking | Collect feedback such as adherence, weight change, and energy level. |
| *Phase 5* | Adaptive Learning | Retrain model weekly using progress data to make adaptive calorie/workout recommendations. |
| *Phase 6* | Multi-User Intelligence | Use collaborative filtering to recommend meals/workouts based on similar users’ success. |
| *Phase 7* | Deployment | Build a Streamlit dashboard for real-time interaction and visualization. |

 *Source:* USDA FoodData Central API (for open-source nutrition data)

---

### C. Exercise Dataset
*Purpose:* To recommend workouts aligned with goal, equipment, and level.

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
